# Pose Residual Network

This is the code for the paper

Muhammed Kocabas, Salih Karagoz, Emre Akbas. MultiPoseNet: Fast Multi-Person Pose Estimation using Pose Residual Network. In ECCV, 2018. https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04067

## Getting Started

We just released only Pose Residual Network part of the paper. We are planing to share whole code after finishing.


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
python
pytorch
numpy
tqdm
pycocotools
progress
scikit-image
```

### Installing

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/salihkaragoz/pose-residual-network-pytorch.git
```
2. Install pytorch that fit your system. [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

3. ```pip install -r src/requirements.txt```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
